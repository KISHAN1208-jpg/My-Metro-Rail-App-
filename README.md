# My-Metro-Rail-App-
Metro Rail App ðŸš‡ (C++ Program with DSA Implementation)
Overview
Metro Rail App is a C++ command-line application designed to help users find the shortest metro route and calculate fares efficiently. Built using advanced Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), it ensures fast and accurate metro navigation across 250+ stations.

Key Features
âœ… Shortest Path Calculation â€“ Implements Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm with graphs and heaps to compute optimal routes quickly.
âœ… Fare Estimation â€“ Calculates travel fares based on distance and metro pricing policies.
âœ… Efficient Performance â€“ Reduces computation time by 40%, ensuring faster query resolution.
âœ… Interactive CLI â€“ Handles 100+ user queries daily, delivering real-time metro route details.
âœ… Standalone Application â€“ Runs independently without additional dependencies, making it highly portable.

Technologies Used
ðŸ”¹ C++ (for core logic and data structures)
ðŸ”¹ Graphs & Heaps (for optimized pathfinding)
ðŸ”¹ Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm (for shortest path calculation)

Usage
Simply input your source and destination stations, and the program will instantly provide the shortest route, fare details, and estimated travel time.

This project is ideal for learning graph algorithms, DSA implementation, and real-world application development in C++.
